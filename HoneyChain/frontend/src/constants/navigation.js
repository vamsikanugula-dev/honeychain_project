/**
 * Navigation models — one workspace per role.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for *who sees what*. The sidebar is
 * rendered from it, the router is guarded by it, and the dashboards read their
 * labels from it, so a module cannot be reachable from a hint in one place and
 * invisible in another.
 *
 * Two rules the shape of the data enforces:
 *
 * 1. A workspace declares its own sections. There is no shared list filtered at
 *    render time, so an entry cannot leak into an unrelated role's sidebar by
 *    being added in the wrong place.
 * 2. A workspace declares the route prefixes its role may open. A path outside
 *    them is not rendered *and* not routable — a typed URL lands the user back in
 *    their own workspace instead of on a "this is not your workspace" screen.
 *
 * Nothing in this file implies a feature exists. Entries exist only for screens
 * that are built; modules that are not built yet are described once in
 * `plannedModules.js` and shown as roadmap notes on the dashboards, never as
 * sidebar links.
