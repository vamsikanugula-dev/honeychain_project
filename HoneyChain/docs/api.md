# HoneyChain API — Reference (v1)

Base URL: `/api/v1` — interactive documentation at `/docs` (Swagger) and `/redoc`
when the API is running.

> **Scope: Phases 1–3.** Authentication, profiles, beekeepers, KVIC clusters, administration
> (Phases 1–2) and the hive registry, IoT devices and telemetry (Phase 3) are implemented and
> documented below. Traceability, blockchain, QR, laboratory, AI and analytics endpoints belong to
> later phases and are listed under "Planned" so integrators know what is coming — nothing there
> exists in the codebase yet.
>
> Phase 3 has its own module reference: `docs/iot.md`.

## 1. Conventions

### 1.1 Response envelope

Success:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { } }
```

Success (paginated — `meta` is added, and omitted entirely when not applicable):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [ ],
  "meta": { "page": 1, "page_size": 20, "total_items": 42, "total_pages": 3 }
}
```

Error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "Invalid request",
             "details": [ { "field": "password", "message": "…", "type": "value_error" } ] },
  "request_id": "5ab0c271-10b2-4ea3-ac06-2be35f972cdf"
}
```

### 1.2 Headers

| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` | request | Required by authenticated endpoints |
| `Content-Type: application/json` | request | For JSON bodies |
| `X-Request-ID` | both | Echoed back; quote it when reporting an issue |
| `Set-Cookie: honeychain_refresh_token=…` | response | HttpOnly, `Path=/api/v1/auth`, `SameSite` from config |
| `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` | response | Sent with every `401` |

### 1.3 Error codes

| --- | --- | --- |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 422 | Request failed schema validation; `details` lists fields |
| `BAD_REQUEST` | 400 | Malformed or unusable request |
| `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` | 401 | No credentials supplied |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | 401 | Email/password combination rejected |

| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | 501 | Reserved for phase-gated features |

---

## 2. Health

### `GET /api/v1/health`

Liveness. Does not touch the database.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

```json
{ "status": "ok", "service": "HoneyChain API" }
```

### `GET /api/v1/health/db`

Readiness: verifies PostgreSQL connectivity and lists applied tables.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "database": { "connected": true, "dialect": "postgresql",
                  "server_version": "17.11", "environment": "development" },
    "tables": ["alembic_version", "refresh_tokens", "users"]
  }
}
```

`status` becomes `degraded` when the database is unreachable (HTTP 200 either way, so a load
balancer can distinguish "API down" from "API up, database down").

### `GET /api/v1/health/detailed`

Per-component report.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "HoneyChain API",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-22T18:30:00Z",
  "components": {
    "database": { "status": "ok", "dialect": "postgresql" },
    "authentication": { "status": "ok", "strategy": "JWT (access + rotating refresh)" },
    "blockchain": { "status": "not_configured", "phase": "Phase 3" },
    "iot": { "status": "not_configured", "phase": "Phase 4" },
    "ai": { "status": "not_configured", "phase": "Phase 5" }
  }
}
```

Future-phase components reporting `not_configured` is expected, not a fault.

---

## 3. Metadata

### `GET /api/v1/roles`

Public. The authoritative role catalogue, used by the registration form, the administration
role picker and the dashboards. All **ten** roles are listed, in the backend's declared
administration order (`UserRole.administration_order()`), with the label the API itself uses.
`self_registrable` marks the two roles a visitor may choose on the public form; everything else is
provisioned by an administrator through `POST /api/v1/admin/users`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "service": "HoneyChain API",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "environment": "development",
    "roles": [
      { "value": "ADMIN", "label": "Administrator", "home_route": "/admin", "self_registrable": false },
      { "value": "BEEKEEPER", "label": "Beekeeper", "home_route": "/beekeeper", "self_registrable": true },
      { "value": "CONSUMER", "label": "Consumer", "home_route": "/consumer", "self_registrable": true },
      { "value": "KVIC_OFFICER", "label": "KVIC officer", "home_route": "/kvic", "self_registrable": false },
      { "value": "PROCESSOR", "label": "Processor", "home_route": "/processor", "self_registrable": false }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Authentication

### `POST /api/v1/auth/register`

Creates an account and immediately opens a session.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | 2–120 characters |
| `email` | string (email) | yes | Stored lower-cased; unique |
| `phone` | string | no | 10-digit Indian numbers are normalised to `+91…`; unique |
| `password` | string | yes | 8–72 bytes, must contain a letter and a digit |
| `confirm_password` | string | no | Must match `password` when supplied |
| `role` | enum | no | Default `BEEKEEPER`. **Only `CONSUMER` and `BEEKEEPER` may be self-assigned**; any other role is rejected with `422` |
| `state`, `district`, `organization` | string | no | Profile context |
| `accepted_terms` | boolean | no | Default `true` |
| `beekeeper` | object | no | Apiary details — accepted only with `role: "BEEKEEPER"` (see below) |

`beekeeper` is an optional block of `village`, `mandal`, `district`, `state`, `pincode`,
`experience_years` (0–90), `bee_species` (≤80 chars) and `number_of_hives` (0–100 000). Every field
is optional: a beekeeper who would rather fill this in later still gets a record — it simply starts
empty. `beekeeper_code` and `kvic_cluster_id` are deliberately not accepted here (`422`): the code is
generated by the platform and cluster membership is granted by an officer after review.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Lakshmi Devi","email":"lakshmi@example.com","phone":"9876543210",
       "password":"HoneyPass123","role":"BEEKEEPER","district":"Guntur"}'
```

`201 Created`:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "e02ef443-9c3b-40c6-a112-1b6c97d9eda1",
      "name": "Lakshmi Devi", "email": "lakshmi@example.com", "phone": "+919876543210",
      "role": "BEEKEEPER", "role_label": "Beekeeper", "account_status": "ACTIVE",
      "state": null, "district": "Guntur", "organization": null,
      "last_login_at": null, "created_at": "…", "updated_at": "…"
    },
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOi…",
    "refresh_token": null,
    "token": { "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 1800, "expires_at": "…" },
    "beekeeper": {
      "id": "…", "beekeeper_code": "BKR-GNT-00004", "verification_status": "PENDING",
      "verification_label": "Pending", "district": "Guntur", "kvic_cluster_id": null
    },
    "home_route": "/beekeeper"
  }
}
```

`beekeeper` is `null` for consumer registrations, and `home_route` is the workspace the client should
open for the new account.

Failures: `409 DUPLICATE_RESOURCE` (email or phone taken), `422 VALIDATION_ERROR` (weak password,
mismatched confirmation, a role that cannot be self-assigned, apiary details sent with a
non-beekeeper role, a cluster claimed at registration, or any extra field).

> `refresh_token` is `null` for browser clients — it is delivered as an HttpOnly cookie. Set
> `AUTH_EXPOSE_REFRESH_IN_BODY=true` for mobile clients, scripts and integration tests.

### `POST /api/v1/auth/login`

| Field | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | string | yes |
| `password` | string | yes |
| `remember_me` | boolean | no |

Returns the same shape as registration. Unknown email and wrong password both return
`401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` with an identical message, so the endpoint cannot be used to discover
which accounts exist. An inactive account returns `403 ACCOUNT_INACTIVE`.

### `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`

Rotates the refresh token. The token is taken from the request body **or** the
`honeychain_refresh_token` cookie.

```bash
# Browser flow — cookie only, no body
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/refresh \
  --cookie "honeychain_refresh_token=…"
```

On success the old token is revoked, a new one is issued (`replaced_by_jti` records the chain) and a
fresh access token is returned. Presenting an already-revoked token is treated as theft: **all**
sessions for that user are revoked and `401 TOKEN_INVALID` is returned.

### `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `refresh_token` | string | Optional; the cookie is used when omitted |
| `all_devices` | boolean | `true` revokes every session for the user |

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "message": "You have been signed out", "revoked_sessions": 1 } }
```

Idempotent — logging out twice is not an error. The cookie is cleared in the response.

### `GET /api/v1/auth/me`

Returns the authenticated user. Used to bootstrap the SPA session on every load.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

`401 AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` (no credentials), `401 TOKEN_INVALID` (bad signature/revoked),
`403 ACCOUNT_INACTIVE` (account disabled after the token was issued).

---

## 5. Users and profiles

### `GET /api/v1/profile` · `PUT /api/v1/profile` · `PATCH /api/v1/profile`

The Phase 2 profile resource: everything the caller may see about their own account in one payload.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "account":  { "id": "…", "name": "Ravi Kumar", "email": "…", "phone": "+919876500001",
                  "role": "BEEKEEPER", "is_active": true, "is_verified": false,
                  "last_login_at": "2026-09-22T19:02:22Z", "created_at": "…" },
    "profile":  { "village": "Tenali", "mandal": "Tenali", "district": "Guntur",
                  "state": "Andhra Pradesh", "pincode": "522201",
                  "profile_photo": null, "date_of_birth": null, "gender": null, "address": null },
    "beekeeper": { "beekeeper_code": "BKR-GNT-00003", "verification_status": "VERIFIED",
                   "verification_label": "Verified", "experience_years": 7,
                   "bee_species": "Apis cerana indica", "number_of_hives": 24,
                   "cluster": { "cluster_code": "KVIC-GNT-001", "cluster_name": "…" } }
  }
}
```

`beekeeper` is `null` for every non-beekeeper role. Every profile field is optional — the API never
demands personal information to hold an account. `PUT` replaces the profile, `PATCH` updates the
supplied fields; account fields (`email`, `role`, `is_active`) are administrator-controlled and are
rejected with `422` rather than ignored.

### `GET /api/v1/users/me`

Same payload as `/auth/me`; provided as a stable resource-oriented path.

### `PATCH /api/v1/users/me`

Updates the caller's own profile. `extra="forbid"`, so `role`, `email`, `is_active` in the body
produce `422` rather than being silently ignored.

```json
{ "name": "Lakshmi Devi", "district": "Krishna", "organization": "Coastal Apiaries" }
```

---

## 6. Beekeepers

### `GET /api/v1/beekeepers/me` · `PUT /api/v1/beekeepers/me`

The caller's own apiary record. `BEEKEEPER_READ_SELF` / `BEEKEEPER_UPDATE_SELF` — held by beekeepers
only, so any other role receives `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`. A beekeeper can edit practice and location
details but never their `verification_status`, `beekeeper_code` or `kvic_cluster_id` (sending one is
a `422`, not a silent no-op).

### `GET /api/v1/beekeepers`

Officer/administrator directory (`BEEKEEPER_READ_ALL`).

| Query | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | Beekeeper code, owner name or e-mail (case-insensitive) |
| `district`, `state` | Exact match |
| `cluster` | Cluster id or cluster code |
| `verification_status` | `PENDING`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `VERIFIED`, `REJECTED`, `SUSPENDED` |
| `bee_species` | Exact match |
| `page`, `page_size` | 1-based; `page_size` 1–100 (default 20) |

Rows are `BeekeeperListItem`s: code, owner name/e-mail, location, hive count, verification status and
cluster. Full detail (owner account, history, allowed transitions) is only returned by the detail
endpoint, so a directory page never ships more data than it renders.

### `GET /api/v1/beekeepers/filters` · `GET /api/v1/beekeepers/summary`

Filter options and counts, both derived from stored rows — never invented. The summary returns
`total`, `by_verification_status`, `by_district` and `assigned_to_cluster`.

### `GET /api/v1/beekeepers/{beekeeper_id}`

Full record plus `owner`, `cluster`, `verification_history` (append-only, newest first) and
`allowed_next_statuses` — the states the workflow permits from the current one.

### `PUT /api/v1/beekeepers/{beekeeper_id}`

Officer correction (`BEEKEEPER_UPDATE_ALL`). The only way to set or clear cluster membership:
`{"kvic_cluster_id": "…"}` assigns, `{"kvic_cluster_id": null}` clears.

### `PATCH /api/v1/beekeepers/{beekeeper_id}/verification`

```json
{ "status": "VERIFIED", "remarks": "Verified after a field visit on 12 Sep." }
```

`BEEKEEPER_VERIFY` (ADMIN and KVIC_OFFICER). Enforces the transition rules
(`PENDING → UNDER_REVIEW → VERIFIED/REJECTED`, `VERIFIED → SUSPENDED`), requires a remark of at
least five characters for `REJECTED`/`SUSPENDED`, writes `verified_by`/`verified_at`, appends a
history row and records an audit entry. Illegal transitions return `422`; the response is the full
updated detail payload.

---

## 7. Clusters

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters` | `CLUSTER_READ` | Filters `search`, `district`, `state`, `is_active`; paginated; includes member counts |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/clusters` | `CLUSTER_MANAGE` | `cluster_code` is generated (`KVIC-GNT-001`) unless one is supplied for a migration |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}` | `CLUSTER_READ` | Cluster + `member_count` + members |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}` | `CLUSTER_MANAGE` | Update name, district, state, description, coordinator |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/status` | `CLUSTER_MANAGE` | `{"is_active": false}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/beekeepers` | `CLUSTER_READ` | Members of the cluster (paginated) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/beekeepers/{beekeeper_id}` | `CLUSTER_MANAGE` | Add membership |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/beekeepers/{beekeeper_id}` | `CLUSTER_MANAGE` | Remove membership — the beekeeper record is untouched |

### 7.1 Cluster views (Phase 4.1)

The five endpoints below are a **view over records that live elsewhere** — the cluster's members'
hives, their devices, the readings those devices stored and the analyses computed from them. None of
them creates a record, and none of them is available to a beekeeper (`403`).

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/summary` | `CLUSTER_ANALYTICS_READ` | Member/hive/device/telemetry/AI counters plus the cluster identity; zeroes when empty |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/hives` | `CLUSTER_ANALYTICS_READ` | The cluster's hives (paginated `HiveListItem` rows), each with its device count |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/devices` | `CLUSTER_ANALYTICS_READ` | Devices attached to those hives, resolved through `hive_code` (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/ai` | `CLUSTER_ANALYTICS_READ` | Latest stored assessment per hive: health indicator and status, disease/swarming risk, projection, data quality, `analysis_source`, `sample_count`; unanalysed hives appear as `analyzed: false` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clusters/{id}/telemetry/latest` | `CLUSTER_ANALYTICS_READ` | Newest stored reading plus the chain `device_id → hive_code → beekeeper_code`; `has_data: false` and a null `reading` when nothing is stored |

Related additions on the hive surface:

| Method | Path | Permission | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/hives?has_cluster=false` | hive read scope | Hives whose owner belongs to no cluster — the administrative worklist. Ignored for a beekeeper's own list. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/hives/summary` | hive read scope | `without_cluster` (staff only) counts hives in no cluster |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/hives/{hive_id}/cluster` | staff only | `{cluster_id: uuid or null, reason ≤ 200}`. `404` unknown cluster, `422` inactive cluster / already in that cluster / clearing an unclustered hive, `403` for a beekeeper. Audited with the previous and new cluster |

`cluster_id` inside a hive create/update payload, or inside a device registration payload, is
rejected `422` — the relationship is never set by a client that way.

Cluster management otherwise stops at CRUD and membership: scheme reporting and exports belong to a
later phase and are not exposed.

---

## 8. Administration (`ADMIN` only)

All routes below require an access token whose role is `ADMIN`; other roles receive
`403 PERMISSION_DENIED` with the required role listed in `details`.

### `GET /api/v1/admin/summary`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "users": {
      "total": 12, "active": 11,
      "by_role": { "ADMIN": 1, "BEEKEEPER": 6, "COLLECTION_CENTER": 1, "PROCESSOR": 1,
                   "LAB_TECHNICIAN": 0, "PACKAGING_UNIT": 1, "DISTRIBUTOR": 1,
                   "RETAILER": 1, "CONSUMER": 0, "KVIC_OFFICER": 0 }
    },
    "modules": { "user_management": "available", "beekeeping": "available",
                 "hives": "available", "iot": "available", "ai": "planned",
                 "blockchain": "planned", "supply_chain": "planned" }
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/admin/users`

| Query | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page` | 1 | 1-based |
| `page_size` | 20 | 1–100 |
| `role` | — | Any role value; unknown values give `422` |
| `is_active` | — | `true` / `false` |

Newest first. Pagination metadata in `meta`.

### `POST /api/v1/admin/users`

Provisions an account for **any of the ten roles** — the administrator's counterpart to public
registration, using the same `users` table, the same bcrypt hashing and the same
`POST /api/v1/auth/login`. Requires `ADMIN_USER_MANAGE` **and** `ADMIN_ROLE_ASSIGN`
(administrators only), enforced on the route and again in the service.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | yes | 2–120 characters |
| `email` | string (email) | yes | Unique |
| `phone` | string | no | Normalised like registration; unique |
| `password` | string | yes | Same policy as registration: 8–72 bytes, a letter and a digit |
| `role` | enum | yes | Any of the ten: `ADMIN`, `BEEKEEPER`, `CONSUMER`, `KVIC_OFFICER`, `COLLECTION_CENTER`, `PROCESSOR`, `LAB_TECHNICIAN`, `PACKAGING_UNIT`, `DISTRIBUTOR`, `RETAILER` |
| `is_active` | boolean | no | Default `true`. `false` creates the account disabled, to be activated later |
| `state`, `district`, `organization` | string | no | Profile context |
| `reason` | string | no | Recorded in the audit log |
| `beekeeper` | object | no | Apiary details — accepted only with `role: "BEEKEEPER"` |

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": { "id": "…", "email": "sita.rao@honeychain.example.com", "role": "LAB_TECHNICIAN",
              "role_label": "Lab technician", "is_active": true },
    "message": "Account created as Lab technician",
    "beekeeper_created": false
  }
}
```

A `BEEKEEPER` account is created together with its beekeeper record in the same transaction, and that
record starts `PENDING` — provisioning an account is not a verification. `409 DUPLICATE_RESOURCE` for
an email or phone already in use; `422` for a weak password, an unknown role, or apiary details
supplied with a non-beekeeper role. Audited as `USER_PROVISIONED`.

### `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/role`

```json
{ "role": "PROCESSOR", "reason": "Moved to the Guntur plant" }
```

Requires `ADMIN_ROLE_ASSIGN`. Returns the account, the `previous_role` and `sessions_revoked`.

Refused with `422` when the caller is changing **their own** role, and when the target is the last
active administrator being moved off `ADMIN`. Live refresh tokens are revoked, because the account's
permissions change the moment the role does. Audited as `USER_ROLE_CHANGED` with both the previous
and the new role; promoting an account to `BEEKEEPER` creates its missing apiary record.

### `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}/status`

```json
{ "is_active": false, "reason": "Duplicate registration" }
```

`404 NOT_FOUND` for an unknown id, `422` for a malformed UUID. Deactivating a user immediately
blocks their `/auth/me` calls with `403 ACCOUNT_INACTIVE` and prevents further sign-ins, and an
administrator cannot deactivate their own account (`422`).

### `GET /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}`

Account detail plus the beekeeper record (when the account is a beekeeper) and the account's recent
audit activity.

### `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-logs`

| Query | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | Exact action code, case-insensitive (`USER_REGISTERED`, `BEEKEEPER_VERIFIED`, …) |
| `entity_type`, `entity_id` | Narrow to one record's history |
| `user_id` | One actor's trail |
| `page`, `page_size` | Paginated |

Entries carry `action`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `metadata`, `description`, `ip_address` and
`created_at`. Metadata is validated on write and never contains passwords, tokens or secrets, and no
endpoint can edit or delete an entry.

### `GET /api/v1/admin/activity`

Counts by action over a rolling window (`window_hours`, default 24) for the administration dashboard.

---

## 9. Hives

Permissions: `HIVE_READ_SELF` / `HIVE_WRITE_SELF` (beekeepers, own apiary) and
`HIVE_READ_ALL` / `HIVE_WRITE_ALL` (KVIC officers and admins, platform-wide).

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/hives` | Filters `status`, `search`, `district`, `state`, `bee_species`, `colony_strength`, `cluster_id`, `beekeeper_id`, `has_device`, `include_removed`; paginated. Each row carries `cluster`, `device_count`, `primary_device` and `latest_reading` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/hives/summary` | `{"total", "by_status", "with_device", "without_device"}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/hives/filters` | District/bee-species/status values present in scope, for filter dropdowns |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/hives` | Create. The `hive_code` is generated server-side (`HIVE-<DISTRICT>-NNNNN`) and cannot be supplied |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/hives/{hive_id}` | Detail: `owner`, `devices` (each with its derived `status`), `sensor_values`, `latest_reading` |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/hives/{hive_id}` | Update apiary location, species, colony/queen observations, notes |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/hives/{hive_id}/status` | `{"status": "ACTIVE", "reason": "…"}` — `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `MAINTENANCE`, `REMOVED` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/hives/{hive_id}?force=` | `409` with device/reading counts while history exists; `force=true` marks it `REMOVED` instead of deleting |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/beekeepers/me/hives` | The signed-in beekeeper's own hives (no id required) |

Colony strength and queen status are the beekeeper's *observations* (`UNKNOWN` until they assess);
the platform never derives them.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "hive_code": "HIVE-GNT-00001", "status": "ACTIVE", "colony_strength": "STRONG",
    "queen_status": "PRESENT", "district": "Guntur", "state": "Andhra Pradesh",
    "device_count": 1, "primary_device": { "device_id": "ESP32-GNT-0001", "status": "ONLINE" },
    "latest_reading": { "timestamp": "2026-09-23T12:54:17Z", "temperature": 30.9,
                        "humidity": 52.98, "weight": 42.79, "source": "SIMULATOR" }
  }
}

## 10. IoT devices and sensors

Permissions: `DEVICE_READ_SELF` / `DEVICE_WRITE_SELF` for a beekeeper's own devices,
`DEVICE_READ_ALL` / `DEVICE_WRITE_ALL` for KVIC and admin. Authorisation is enforced in the service
layer: a cross-owner read answers `404` (the record is not confirmed to exist) and a cross-owner
telemetry write answers `403`.

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/devices` | Filters `search`, `status`, `hive_id`, `beekeeper_id`, `device_type`, `connection_type`; paginated. Rows include `sensors`, `last_reading` and derived `status` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/summary` | Fleet counters for the monitoring screen: `total_devices`, `connected_devices`, `offline_devices`, `warning_devices`, `maintenance_devices`, `sensors_active`, `hives_without_device`, `readings_last_window`, `offline_threshold_seconds`, `last_telemetry_at` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/iot/devices` | Register against one of your hives. Seeds the five sensor configurations. `422` on a duplicate `device_id` (case-insensitive) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/heartbeat` | `{"device_id": "…"}` — reachability without a reading; marks the device `ONLINE` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/{device_id}` | Detail with `sensors`, `last_reading`, `seconds_since_last_seen` |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/{device_id}` | Name, firmware version, connection type, install date, MQTT topic |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/{device_id}/status` | `ONLINE`, `OFFLINE`, `WARNING` honour the derived value (a manual `OFFLINE` clears on the next packet); `MAINTENANCE` is sticky |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/{device_id}?confirm=` | `409` with the reading count while telemetry exists; `?confirm=true` deletes the device and its readings |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/{device_id}/sensors` | The device's sensor configuration |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/iot/devices/{device_id}/sensors/{sensor_type}` | Any of `enabled`, `sensor_name`, `unit`, `sampling_interval` (1–86400 s), `min_valid_value`, `max_valid_value` — e.g. `{"enabled": true, "sensor_name": "Brood temperature", "max_valid_value": 45}` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/me/devices` | Every device the caller owns |

Device registration body:

```json
{
  "device_id": "ESP32-GNT-0001",
  "device_name": "Guntur apiary node A",
  "hive_id": "3f1c…",
  "device_type": "ESP32",
  "connection_type": "MQTT",
  "firmware_version": "1.0.0",
  "installed_at": "2026-09-01T09:00:00Z"
}
```

## 11. Telemetry

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/iot/telemetry` | One reading. `telemetry_ingest` permission on your own device |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/iot/telemetry/batch` | 1–200 readings (bare JSON array); the response reports `submitted`, `stored`, `duplicates`, `rejected_count`, `rejected[{index, reason}]` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/telemetry/{hive_id}` | Stored history for a hive. `range` (`1h`, `6h`, `24h`, `7d`, `30d`) or an explicit `from`/`to`; `interval` (`1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `6h`, `1d`) returns averaged buckets instead of raw points; also `sensor_type`, `device_id` (`device_pk`) and `limit` (≤ 2000). The response carries `points`, `latest`, `source_mix` and a `message` when the window is empty |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/telemetry/{hive_id}/latest` | Newest values per device on the hive |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/iot/last-telemetry` | Most recent reading in scope; always returns a body, with `has_data: false` when the scope is empty |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/health/mqtt` | Consumer status (`connected` / `disconnected` / `stopped` / `not_configured`), topic, counters and `last_error` |

```json
// POST /api/v1/iot/telemetry
{
  "device_id": "ESP32-GNT-0001",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-23T12:54:17Z",
  "temperature": 30.9, "humidity": 52.98, "weight": 42.79,
  "vibration": 0.43, "acoustic_level": 38.65,
  "battery_level": 94, "signal_strength": -63,
  "source": "SIMULATOR"
}
```

Rules: at least one measurement is required; unknown fields are `422`; values outside the
data-validity ranges are rejected with the field named in `details` and are **never clamped**;
`(device_id, timestamp)` is idempotent, so a replay is reported as `duplicate`. The server decides
the effective `source`: `SIMULATOR` when declared, `MANUAL` for an authenticated HTTP submission
otherwise, and `REAL_DEVICE` for an unlabelled packet arriving over MQTT.

Full contract, ranges, MQTT topics and the hardware hand-off: `docs/iot.md`.
