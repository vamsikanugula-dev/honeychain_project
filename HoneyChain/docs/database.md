# HoneyChain — Database design

Engine: **PostgreSQL 15+** (developed against 17). Access: SQLAlchemy 2.0 through
`psycopg` 3. Migrations: Alembic.

---

## 1. Design rules

| Rule | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| **UUID primary keys** (`gen_random_uuid()`) | Identifiers appear in public trace URLs and QR codes (Phase 4); sequential integers would leak volumes and invite enumeration |
| **Every table has `created_at` / `updated_at`** | Audit and dispute resolution across the supply chain |
| **Timestamps are `timestamptz` (UTC)** | Participants span districts, states and time zones |
| **Named constraints** via a metadata naming convention | Stable, readable Alembic diffs (`pk_users`, `uq_users_phone`, `fk_refresh_tokens_user_id_users`) |
| **`ON DELETE CASCADE` for owned rows** | Sessions must die with the account |
| **Enums for closed vocabularies** | Roles and statuses are validated by the database, not only by the application |
| **Unique constraints for real-world uniqueness** | `email`, `phone`, `refresh_tokens.token_hash`, `refresh_tokens.jti` |
| **Indexes justified by queries** | Not "just in case" |

---

## 2. Phase 1 schema

### 2.1 `users`

The single identity record for all ten roles. Role-specific profile data (apiary details, licences,
processing capacity) belongs in tables added by later phases — this table deliberately stays narrow.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK, default `gen_random_uuid()` | |
| `name` | varchar(120) | not null, `CHECK length(name) >= 2` | |
| `email` | varchar(255) | not null, **unique** | Stored lower-cased; login is case-insensitive |
| `phone` | varchar(20) | unique, nullable | Normalised to E.164 (`+91…`) |
| `password_hash` | varchar(255) | not null | bcrypt, cost 12. No plaintext column exists |
| `role` | `user_role` enum | not null, default `CONSUMER` | Ten values, see below |
| `is_active` | boolean | not null, default true | Administrators can suspend an account |
| `state` | varchar(80) | nullable | Onboarding/analytics context |
| `district` | varchar(80) | nullable | Cluster mapping in later phases |
| `organization` | varchar(160) | nullable | Co-operative, lab or company |
| `last_login_at` | timestamptz | nullable | Set on successful login only |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | not null, default `now()` | |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | not null, default `now()` | Refreshed on modification |

Indexes: `ix_users_email` (unique), `ix_users_role`, `ix_users_role_active (role, is_active)`,
`uq_users_phone` (unique).

`ix_users_role_active` supports the administrator directory ("active beekeepers in this cluster")
without a full scan, which matters once clusters hold thousands of accounts.

### 2.2 `refresh_tokens`

Server-side session records. This is what makes logout, rotation and replay detection possible for
an otherwise stateless JWT architecture.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK | |
| `user_id` | uuid | FK → `users.id` ON DELETE CASCADE, not null | |
| `token_hash` | varchar(64) | not null, **unique** | SHA-256 of the token. The raw token is never stored |
| `jti` | varchar(64) | not null, **unique** | JWT id claim, correlates rotations |
| `replaced_by_jti` | varchar(64) | nullable | Points at the token that superseded this one |
| `revoked` | boolean | not null, default false | |
| `revoked_at` | timestamptz | nullable | |
| `revoke_reason` | varchar(80) | nullable | `logout`, `logout_all`, `rotated`, `reuse_detected`, `expired` |
| `expires_at` | timestamptz | not null | |
| `last_used_at` | timestamptz | nullable | Updated on refresh |
| `device` | varchar(64) | nullable | Hashed user-agent + IP fingerprint (audit display only) |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamptz | not null | |

Indexes: `ix_refresh_tokens_token_hash` (unique), `ix_refresh_tokens_user_id`,
`ix_refresh_tokens_user_active (user_id, revoked)`, `ix_refresh_tokens_expires_at`.

Why store a hash rather than nothing at all? A purely stateless refresh token cannot be revoked —
logout would only be cosmetic until expiry. Storing a fingerprint gives immediate revocation while
keeping a database leak non-replayable.

### 2.3 `user_role` enum

```text
ADMIN · BEEKEEPER · COLLECTION_CENTER · PROCESSOR · LAB_TECHNICIAN
PACKAGING_UNIT · DISTRIBUTOR · RETAILER · CONSUMER · KVIC_OFFICER
```

Declared with the full role vocabulary from the start: adding a role later would otherwise require
a migration plus client changes. The database type is created by the initial migration and dropped
explicitly on downgrade.

---

## 3. Phase 2 schema

Migration `c71dce65bc61` extends `users` and adds seven tables. All of it is Alembic-generated; no
manual DDL exists anywhere in the project.

### 3.1 `users` (extended)

| Added column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phone` | varchar(20) | **Unique where provided** — `NULL`s are allowed to repeat |
| `is_verified` | boolean, default false | Account-level verification, distinct from beekeeper verification |
| `deactivated_at` | timestamptz | Set when an administrator deactivates the account |
| `last_login_at` | timestamptz | Written on successful login only |

`uq_users_phone` is a unique index, so several accounts without a phone number coexist.

### 3.2 `user_profiles`

Optional personal and location detail for any account — one row per user, created on first write.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_id` | uuid | PK and FK → `users.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `profile_photo` | varchar(512) | A URL; file storage is out of scope for this phase |
| `date_of_birth` | date | Checked to be in the past and plausible |
| `gender` | varchar(20) | Free vocabulary, nullable |
| `address` | text | |
| `village`, `mandal`, `district`, `state` | varchar | `district`/`state` indexed |
| `pincode` | varchar(10) | `CHECK pincode ~ '^[1-9][0-9]{5}$'` |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

### 3.3 `beekeepers`

One row per beekeeper user, enforced by `uq_beekeepers_user_id`.

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `user_id` | uuid | FK → `users.id`, **unique**, `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `beekeeper_code` | varchar(40) | **Unique**, generated (`BKR-GNT-00001`) from `document_sequences` |
| `experience_years` | integer | `CHECK 0…90` when present |
| `bee_species` | varchar(80) | |
| `number_of_hives` | integer | `CHECK 0…100 000` when present |
| `village`, `mandal`, `district`, `state`, `pincode` | varchar | `pincode` shares the PIN-code check |
| `kvic_cluster_id` | uuid | FK → `kvic_clusters.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`; `NULL` = unassigned |
| `registration_date` | date | Set on creation |
| `verification_status` | `verification_status` enum | Default `PENDING` |
| `verification_remarks` | text | Latest decision's remark |
| `verified_by_id` | uuid | FK → `users.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `verified_at` | timestamptz | |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

Indexes: `ix_beekeepers_district_status (district, verification_status)` and
`ix_beekeepers_cluster_status (kvic_cluster_id, verification_status)` — the two shapes every directory
query uses.

### 3.4 `kvic_clusters`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `cluster_code` | varchar(40) | **Unique**, generated (`KVIC-GNT-001`) |
| `cluster_name` | varchar(160) | `CHECK length >= 3` |
| `district`, `state` | varchar(80) | Not null; indexed with `is_active` |
| `description` | text | |
| `coordinator_name`, `coordinator_phone` | varchar | |
| `is_active` | boolean, default true | Deactivated clusters keep their members |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

### 3.5 `beekeeper_verification_history` (append-only)

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `beekeeper_id` | uuid | FK → `beekeepers.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `previous_status` | enum | `NULL` for the opening `None → PENDING` row |
| `new_status` | enum | |
| `remarks` | text | Required by the API for `REJECTED`/`SUSPENDED` |
| `changed_by_id` | uuid | FK → `users.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `changed_by_name`, `changed_by_role` | varchar | Denormalised so the trail survives an account being removed |
| `changed_at` | timestamptz | Indexed with `beekeeper_id` |

The application only ever inserts here: no update or delete path exists, which is what makes the
review trail trustworthy.

### 3.6 `audit_logs`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `user_id` | uuid | FK → `users.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `actor_email`, `actor_role` | varchar | Denormalised actor identity |
| `action` | varchar(60) | Event vocabulary (`USER_REGISTERED`, `BEEKEEPER_VERIFIED`, …) |
| `entity_type`, `entity_id` | varchar | What was acted on |
| `event_metadata` | jsonb | Validated on write; never holds passwords, tokens or secrets |
| `description` | text | Human-readable summary |
| `ip_address`, `user_agent` | varchar | Request context |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Indexed with `action` and with `user_id` |

Written inside a SAVEPOINT (`begin_nested()`), so a failure to audit can never abort the business
transaction it describes.

### 3.7 `document_sequences`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scope` | varchar(80) | **Unique** — e.g. `beekeeper:BKR-GNT`, `cluster:KVIC-GNT` |
| `last_value` | integer | Allocated with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` inside the owning transaction |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

`document_sequences` is what makes `BKR-GNT-00001` and `HIVE-GNT-00001` race-free and gapless per
district without a sequence explosion, and it keeps the human-readable code independent of the row's
UUID. Phase 3 adds the `HIVE:<PREFIX>` scope (see §4).

### 3.8 `verification_status` enum

```text
PENDING · UNDER_REVIEW · VERIFIED · REJECTED · SUSPENDED
```

Legal transitions are enforced in the application (`VerificationStatus.allowed_transitions`) as well
as by the service layer, so an illegal jump is rejected with `422` before it reaches the database.

---

## 4. Phase 3 schema — hive registry and telemetry

Four tables, plus two code-generation and history habits carried over from Phase 2 (root codes come
from `document_sequences`; nothing is ever hard-deleted when it holds evidence).

### 4.1 `hives`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `hive_code` | varchar(24) | **Unique**, `HIVE-<DISTRICT>-NNNNN`, generated from `document_sequences` |
| `beekeeper_id` | uuid | FK → `beekeepers.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`, indexed |
| `cluster_id` | uuid | FK → `kvic_clusters.id`, nullable, `ON DELETE SET NULL` |
| `status` | `hive_status` | `ACTIVE` (default), `INACTIVE`, `MAINTENANCE`, `REMOVED` |
| `colony_strength` | `colony_strength` | `UNKNOWN` (default), `WEAK`, `MODERATE`, `STRONG` — the beekeeper's observation |
| `queen_status` | `queen_status` | `UNKNOWN` (default), `PRESENT`, `ABSENT`, `UNDER_OBSERVATION` — an observation, not an inference |
| `bee_species` | varchar(80) | Optional (`Apis cerana indica`, …) |
| `installation_date` | date | Optional |
| `village`, `mandal`, `district`, `state`, `pincode` | varchar | Apiary location; `pincode` is 6 digits when present |
| `latitude`, `longitude` | numeric | Optional pair — both or neither |
| `notes` | text | Optional, ≤ 2000 characters |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

Indexes: `beekeeper_id`, `cluster_id`, `status`, `district`, and a unique index on `hive_code`.
Deleting a hive that has devices or readings is refused by the service; it becomes `REMOVED`, which
keeps the telemetry series interpretable.

### 4.2 `iot_devices`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `device_id` | varchar(40) | **Unique** (case-insensitive), pattern `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{3,39}$` |
| `device_name` | varchar(120) | Human label |
| `device_type` | `device_type` | `ESP32` (default), `ESP32_GATEWAY`, `LORA_NODE`, `OTHER` |
| `connection_type` | `connection_type` | `MQTT` (default), `WIFI`, `LORA`, `LORA_MQTT`, `CELLULAR` |
| `hive_id` | uuid | FK → `hives.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL`, indexed |
| `beekeeper_id` | uuid | FK → `beekeepers.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` — the ownership column every query filters on |
| `status` | `device_status` | `OFFLINE` when registered; **derived** at read time from `last_seen` + `battery_level` |
| `last_seen` | timestamptz | Updated by a stored packet, heartbeat or status message |
| `battery_level` | smallint | 0–100, last reported |
| `signal_strength` | smallint | −140…0 dBm, last reported (null when the device does not send it) |
| `firmware_version` | varchar(40) | Optional |
| `mqtt_topic` | varchar(160) | Default `<prefix>/devices/{device_id}/telemetry`, shown in the UI |
| `installed_at` | timestamptz | Optional |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

`status` is stored as well as derived: the stored value is what a sweep persists, the derived value
is what every response reports, and the two can only disagree between a packet and the next sweep.

### 4.3 `sensor_configs`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `device_id` | uuid | FK → `iot_devices.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`, indexed |
| `sensor_type` | `sensor_type` | `TEMPERATURE`, `HUMIDITY`, `WEIGHT`, `VIBRATION`, `ACOUSTIC`, `BATTERY` |
| `sensor_name` | varchar(80) | Display label |
| `unit` | varchar(16) | `°C`, `%`, `kg`, `g`, `dB` |
| `enabled` | boolean | Default `true` |
| `sampling_interval` | integer | Suggested seconds between readings (≥ 1, default 300) |
| `min_valid_value`, `max_valid_value` | numeric(10,3) | Optional per-sensor narrowing of the global range |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | timestamptz | |

Unique on `(device_id, sensor_type)`. Registration seeds the five sensors an ESP32 hive node carries
(`DEFAULT_SENSOR_SPECS`); `BATTERY` and `SIGNAL` are device-health facts rather than configured
sensors, so they are stored on the device row and in each reading instead.

### 4.4 `sensor_readings` (wide)

| Column | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `device_id` | uuid | FK → `iot_devices.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `hive_id` | uuid | FK → `hives.id`, **NOT NULL** — denormalised for one-index history reads |
| `beekeeper_id` | uuid | FK → `beekeepers.id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` — denormalised for apiary-wide queries |
| `timestamp` | timestamptz | **Unique with `device_id`** (`uq_sensor_readings_device_timestamp`) — makes ingest idempotent |
| `temperature` | numeric(6,2) | °C, −20…80 |
| `humidity` | numeric(5,2) | %, 0…100 |
| `weight` | numeric(8,3) | kg, ≥ 0 |
| `vibration` | numeric(6,3) | g, ≥ 0 |
| `acoustic_level` | numeric(6,2) | dB (relative activity), ≥ 0 |
| `battery_level` | smallint | % (optional) |
| `signal_strength` | smallint | dBm (optional) |
| `source` | `telemetry_source` | `REAL_DEVICE`, `SIMULATOR`, `MANUAL` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | Receipt time; `timestamp` is measurement time |

Indexes: `(hive_id, timestamp)`, `(device_id, timestamp)`, `(beekeeper_id, timestamp)` — the three
access patterns the module actually uses (one hive's history, one device's history, one apiary's
readings). A wide row rather than an entity-attribute-value table keeps a packet to a single insert
and a chart query to a single scan; a sensor a device does not carry stays `NULL` and is rendered as
"No data" rather than as a zero.

### 4.5 New enums

```text
hive_status        ACTIVE · INACTIVE · MAINTENANCE · REMOVED
colony_strength    UNKNOWN · WEAK · MODERATE · STRONG
queen_status       UNKNOWN · PRESENT · ABSENT · UNDER_OBSERVATION
device_type        ESP32 · ESP32_GATEWAY · LORA_NODE · OTHER
connection_type    WIFI · LORA · MQTT · LORA_MQTT · CELLULAR
device_status      ONLINE · OFFLINE · WARNING · MAINTENANCE
sensor_type        TEMPERATURE · HUMIDITY · WEIGHT · VIBRATION · ACOUSTIC · BATTERY
telemetry_source   REAL_DEVICE · SIMULATOR · MANUAL
```

The migration creates and drops these types explicitly, so `alembic downgrade base` leaves no orphan
types behind (guarded by `tests/test_migrations.py`).

---

## 5. Role of the ORM

- All access goes through `app/repositories/*`; routes and services never build SQL.
- Repositories use SQLAlchemy expression constructs, so every value is parameter-bound — which is
  what protects against SQL injection.
- Sessions are per-request (`get_db`) and rolled back automatically when an exception escapes,
  leaving each request as a single unit of work.
- `expire_on_commit=False` keeps ORM objects usable after the service commits, so the route can
  serialise the response without triggering late implicit queries.

---

## 6. Migration workflow

```bash
cd backend

# Apply everything
alembic upgrade head

# After changing models — generate, then REVIEW the file
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add hives and harvests"

# Step back / forward
alembic downgrade -1
alembic upgrade head

# Inspect
alembic current
alembic history --verbose

# Emit SQL without a database (for DBA review)
alembic upgrade head --sql
```

Guidelines:

1. **Review autogenerated migrations.** Alembic cannot detect enum value additions/changes, renames,
   or data backfills.
2. **Never edit an applied migration.** Add a new one.
3. **Downgrades must work.** PostgreSQL DDL is transactional, so `transaction_per_migration=True` in
   `alembic/env.py` makes a failed migration roll back cleanly.
4. **The URL is never in `alembic.ini`** — `env.py` reads it from application settings so migrations
   always target the same database as the API, with no credentials in version control.
5. **Tests guard the chain**: `tests/test_migrations.py` asserts a single head, the expected tables
   and the presence of the explicit enum teardown.

---

## 6.1 Phase 4.1 — no schema change, one backfill

Phase 4.1 (the organisational relationship `KVIC → Cluster → Beekeeper → Hive → IoT → Telemetry →
AI`) added **no table and no column**: `beekeepers.kvic_cluster_id` and `hives.cluster_id` already
expressed the relationship, both indexed, with `ix_hives_cluster_status` available for the cluster
views. What was missing was history, so the phase shipped one data-only migration:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Revision | `5e2b7d41c8aa` (`down_revision = a77f6c38aaff`) |
| Statement | `UPDATE hives SET cluster_id = beekeepers.kvic_cluster_id FROM beekeepers WHERE hives.beekeeper_id = beekeepers.id AND hives.cluster_id IS NULL AND beekeepers.kvic_cluster_id IS NOT NULL` |
| Idempotent | Yes — only `NULL` placements are filled, so a second run changes nothing |
| Invents nothing | A beekeeper with no cluster leaves their hives unassigned; those hives are listed for staff via `has_cluster=false` |
| Overwrites nothing | A hive deliberately placed in another cluster keeps its placement |
| Downgrade | No-op by design: clearing the values would hide hives from the cluster that owns them |

The relationship's integrity is enforced by the existing foreign keys
(`hives.beekeeper_id`, `hives.cluster_id`, `iot_devices.hive_id`, `sensor_readings.hive_id`, …), most
of them `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so removing a cluster leaves the hives intact and merely unassigned.

---

## 7. Planned phase 5–6 tables

Indicative shapes — finalised with each phase's requirements, following the rules in section 1.
Phases 1–4.1 are implemented (sections 2–4 and 6.1); the tables below do not exist yet.

| Phase | Tables | Key relationships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | `harvests`, `inspections` | `harvests.hive_id → hives.id` (already in place from Phase 3); `harvests.beekeeper_id → beekeepers.id` |
| 4 | `honey_batches`, `batch_events`, `processing_events`, `quality_tests`, `packaging`, `qr_codes`, `blockchain_transactions`, `distribution`, `retail` | `honey_batches.harvest_id → harvests.id`; batch lineage through a self-referencing `parent_batch_id` for splits and blends; every anchored event gets a `blockchain_transactions` row |
| 5 | `ai_predictions` | `ai_predictions.hive_id` / `batch_id` + `model_version` for reproducibility; inputs are the Phase 3 sensor series |
| 6 | `notifications` | `notifications.user_id → users.id`; device-offline and battery events come from Phase 3 telemetry |

When `sensor_readings` grows into the tens of millions of rows, the next step is monthly range
partitioning on `timestamp` — the three indexes are already aligned with that key.

Two design commitments for later phases:

- **Batch lineage, not batch replacement.** A batch keeps its parents, so a blended or split lot can
  still be traced back to source hives. This is the backbone of consumer verification.
- **Measurements, not verdicts.** `quality_tests` stores parameter values (`moisture`, `hmf`,
  `sucrose`, …) with method and instrument context, so the platform reports what was measured and
  who measured it, never a bare "pure" claim.

---

## 8. Operations

**Backups and restore**

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U honeychain -Fc honeychain_dev  > honeychain_$(date +%F).dump
pg_restore -h localhost -U honeychain -d honeychain_dev honeychain_2026-09-22.dump
```

**Housekeeping.** Expired refresh-token rows accumulate; `RefreshTokenRepository.purge_expired()`
exists for a scheduled job (cron / APScheduler) and should be wired up when the notification and
scheduler modules land.

**Connection handling.** The engine uses `pool_pre_ping=True` (transparently discards connections
dropped by the server or a pooler) and `pool_recycle=1800`, with pool size and overflow configurable
through `DB_POOL_SIZE` / `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`.

**Least privilege.** The application role should own only its own database. Schema-changing
privileges are needed solely by the migration role if a separate one is used in production.
