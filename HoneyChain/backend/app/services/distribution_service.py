"""Distribution and retail receipt: moving packages, and confirming they arrived.

One shipment, one journey
-------------------------
A shipment is created naming a package, a quantity and a destination. From there
it moves through endpoints of its own — dispatch, in transit, delivery — so each
step has its own actor, its own timestamp and its own audit row. A caller never
sends a status: the field a request may carry is the *note* that goes with the
move, and the transition table decides whether the move is legal at all.

What the checks are for
-----------------------
* **Not more than exists.** A shipment may not carry more of a package than the
  package still has unshipped. Cancelled shipments consume nothing, which is what
  makes cancelling safe rather than a way to lose honey.
* **No delivery without a dispatch.** ``DELIVERED`` requires a recorded
  ``dispatched_at``; the database check constraint enforces it as well, so even a
  bug in this module cannot write the impossible state.
* **One confirmation, from the receiver.** The retailer's receipt is recorded as
  ``received_by_id`` / ``received_at`` — a distinct fact from the carrier's
  delivery — and that is what closes the package.

The batch follows its packages
------------------------------
When the first shipment of a batch leaves, the batch becomes ``DISTRIBUTION``;
when every package of the batch has been delivered *and* nothing of the approved
quantity is left unpacked, the batch becomes ``COMPLETED``. Both moves go through
``batch_lifecycle.advance``, so the map of legal moves remains the only authority
on where a batch may go.
