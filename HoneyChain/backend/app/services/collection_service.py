"""Collection business logic.

This is where the Phase-5 promises are actually kept. Three of them are load
bearing, and all three are enforced here rather than in a route or a React
component:

1. **The server decides who and where.** ``beekeeper_id`` comes from the
   authenticated user's own beekeeper record, and ``cluster_id`` from that
   record's *current* cluster link — the Phase-4.1 relationship, read fresh on
   every write. No request body can influence either, and a hive the caller does
   not own is rejected before anything is written, so a beekeeper cannot record
   honey from somebody else's hive.

2. **The harvested quantity is a fact; the AI yield is an estimate.** They live
   in separate columns. When an analysis exists its predicted yield is
   *snapshotted alongside* the weighed harvest so a batch can later show the two
   side by side; when none exists the AI fields stay ``NULL`` and the UI says so.
   Nothing is derived from an estimate and no estimate is ever presented as
   harvested honey.

3. **Completion is one transaction that produces exactly one batch.** The status
   change, the batch row, the link and the audit entries commit together or not
   at all. Retrying a completion returns the batch that already exists instead of
   creating a second one, and the unique constraint on ``honey_batches.collection_id``
   makes a duplicate impossible even under concurrency.

Codes are reserved inside the caller's transaction
(``DocumentSequence.next_value`` performs an atomic upsert), so two beekeepers
completing a harvest at the same instant cannot be handed the same code.
