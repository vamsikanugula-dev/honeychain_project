"""The batch lifecycle — declared once, enforced everywhere.

A batch moves through the supply chain, and every move in this platform goes
through :func:`advance`. The table of permitted moves lives in
:data:`~app.models.enums.BATCH_STATUS_TRANSITIONS`; this module is the only thing
that reads it, so "the backend enforces transitions" is a property of the code
rather than a promise in a document.

What that buys
--------------
* a client cannot set a status at all — no request model contains one;
* a caller cannot jump the queue (``COLLECTED`` → ``APPROVED`` is refused);
* a module cannot invent the next stage either: reaching ``PACKAGED`` fails here
  until a later phase deliberately extends the map and ships a migration with it;
* the same rule applies to the actor that legitimately owns each step, because
  ownership is checked before the transition, not instead of it.
