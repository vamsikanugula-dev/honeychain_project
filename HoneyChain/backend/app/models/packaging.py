"""``packaging_units``, ``packaging_records`` and ``packages``.

Three tables, split along the lines the supply chain actually draws:

``packaging_units``
    The place where packing happens, registered the same way a processing unit
    and a laboratory are — a name, where it is, who runs it, and whether it is
    operating. Deliberately small: packaging needs a facility *reference*, not a
    facility-management system.

``packaging_records``
    One packing operation performed on one approved batch: how much honey went
    in, how much came out as packages, what the packages are and what they
    weigh. A batch may be packed in several runs (the first run clears part of
    the approved quantity, a later run the rest), which is why this is a table
    rather than a column on the batch.

``packages``
    One row per physical package, created when a packaging run completes. These
    rows are the stable identity the rest of the chain moves: a distribution
    names packages, not batches, and the identifier printed on a package is the
    one the platform will keep for its whole life.

What is *not* here
------------------
Nothing in this module alters the batch, the collection or the processing run.
Quantities are recorded next to each other and never overwritten: what was
harvested stays harvested, what was processed stays processed, and what was
packed is a third fact. No ledger entry, no hash and no QR payload is written
here — those belong to later phases; what this phase leaves behind for them is
stable identifiers and timestamps.
