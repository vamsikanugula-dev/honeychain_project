"""Permission catalogue and reusable FastAPI authorization dependencies.

Why permissions rather than scattered role checks
-------------------------------------------------
Writing ``if user.role not in ("ADMIN", "KVIC_OFFICER")`` in a dozen routes
guarantees the rules will drift. Instead:

* every capability is a named ``Permission``;
* ``ROLE_PERMISSIONS`` is the single place mapping roles to capabilities;
* routes declare what they need — ``Depends(require_permission(Permission.BEEKEEPER_READ_ALL))``.

Adding a role or re-scoping a capability is then a one-line change here, and the
whole surface follows.

The frontend mirrors this catalogue only to *hide* navigation it cannot use.
Authorisation is always re-checked here on the server.
