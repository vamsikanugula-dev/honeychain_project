"""Laboratory routes — the platform's quality-decision surface.

The endpoints are grouped by who uses them:

* **Recording the work** — opening a test with its sample, recording measured
  values, correcting them while the test is open, completing the test. A
  laboratory technician holds this, and nothing else here changes a batch's fate
  on its own: ``complete`` evaluates what was recorded.
* **Deciding against the records** — ``POST /lab-tests/{id}/override``. Only an
  administrator holds this, a reason is mandatory, and the test is marked as
  overridden for every reader afterwards.
* **Configuration** — ``PATCH /lab-parameters/{code}``. Ranges and required flags
  live here, separate from measurement, and a range cannot be set without stating
  where it came from.
* **Reading** — tests, their results, the catalogue, and the worklist of batches
  awaiting testing.

There is no endpoint that accepts an overall result, none that sets a parameter's
status by hand, and none that changes a batch's status directly. Those absences
are the enforcement.
