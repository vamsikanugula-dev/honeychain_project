"""Distribution and retailer routes — shipments, their journey, and its receipt.

``POST /distribution`` / ``PATCH /distribution/{id}``
    Raise a shipment against a *released* package, and correct it before it leaves.
``POST /distribution/{id}/{dispatch,in-transit,deliver,cancel}``
    Move it along, one recorded step at a time. A delivery is refused unless a
    dispatch preceded it — in the service, and in a database check constraint.
``GET /distribution`` / ``GET /distribution/{id}`` / ``GET /distribution/summary``
    Read the register, one shipment with its whole provenance, and the counters.
``GET /retailer/shipments`` / ``GET /retailer/packages``
    What is inbound to, and held by, the signed-in retailer. Bounded by the
    shipments addressed to that account, not by a filter the client sends.
``POST /retailer/shipments/{id}/receive``
    The retailer's own confirmation of receipt.

Nothing here writes a status. Every endpoint performs one named act, and the
service decides from the stored record whether that act is legal.
