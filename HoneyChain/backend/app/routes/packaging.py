"""Packaging routes — the worklist, the runs, the packages they produce.

``GET /packaging/approved-batches``
    The batches a packaging unit may take work from. Only laboratory-approved
    batches are returned, and each row carries the quantities already recorded
    against it — the collection, the processing output, what is already packed
    and what is left. It is a *view of the batch*, not a copy of it.
``POST /packaging`` / ``PATCH /packaging/{id}``
    Open a run and record what was packed while it is open.
``POST /packaging/{id}/{start,complete,cancel}``
    Move the run along. Completion is what creates the package rows and moves the
    batch to ``PACKAGED``; there is no endpoint that sets either by hand.
``GET /packages`` / ``GET /packages/{id}`` / ``GET /batches/{id}/packages``
    The package register, read from the rows that exist.
``POST /packages/{id}/release`` / ``POST /packaging/{id}/release``
    Release packages for distribution — existence is not readiness.
``GET /packaging/summary``
    Counters for the workspace dashboard.

Authorization is declared per endpoint and re-checked in the service, which also
narrows every read to the caller's scope. A packaging unit reaches packaging rows;
a beekeeper reaches the packages of their own honey; nobody reaches a write they
do not hold the permission for.
