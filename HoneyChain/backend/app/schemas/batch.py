"""Request and response models for honey batches.

There is **no** ``BatchUpdate`` model, and that is the point. Everything a batch
says about a harvest — its code, its collection, the source hives, the date, the
quantity, the unit, the beekeeper and the cluster — is fixed when it is created.
No Prompt 5 endpoint accepts a body that could alter any of it, so the API cannot
be used to rewrite history even by mistake.

Status and stage are reported with the full lifecycle so the UI can render the
timeline honestly: ``COLLECTION`` is reached, everything after it is *not
started*. Those later stages are listed, never claimed.
