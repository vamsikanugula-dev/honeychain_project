"""Request and response models for processing units and processing runs.

Two shapes are deliberately absent from every request model: ``processing_code``
and ``status``. The code is issued by the platform, and the status is a
consequence of the operations the endpoints perform — a caller starts a run, it
does not declare one started. ``extra="forbid"`` means an attempt to send either
is a 422 rather than a silently ignored field.
